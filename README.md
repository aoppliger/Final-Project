# Final-Project
For this project I made an enclosure that has an opening door and LED lights that are controlled by a distance sensor. The distance sensor sends an signal to the Arduino when an object is within a set distance. This triggers the servo and LED’s which stay open/illuminated for approximately two seconds. Through this project I learned about trigger/echo sensors that both send and receive an electric current as well as how to use continuous rotation servos. The most difficult problem I encountered was having code that was too long, causing the LED’s the flash due to the refresh rate. I had trouble controlling the brightness of the LED’s and chose to keep them at one brightness rather than having them dim. The ultrasonic sensor was a little tricky too find the correct distances as it was very sensitive.
